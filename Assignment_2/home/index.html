                    Hi, there! I'm Hawa, a back-end engineering student at AltSchool Africa. I'm passionate about
                    leveraging my skills in
                    technology to build products that provides a solution to the myriad of problems occuring in the
                    world, especially SDGs. You're

                    <p>A video showing the beautiful scenery of Idanre hills, Akure from miles away. The hills have this
                        foggy cast over them from
                        afar. Fun fact, it rained in the areas surrounded
                        by hills and didn't rain when we were approaching the city- the land was very dry

                    <p>Yeah, just me against one of the ginormous hills at Idanre hills. The hills are pretty talland it was
                        one long journey to the top of the mountain.</p>

                    <p>To my utmost surprise, after climbing thousands of rocks (supposedly staircases), I finally got to
                        the top. I remember there are about 5 layers of staircases with each layer, more difficult than the 
                        next. The indigenes of this community actually do this everyday so it's a walk in th park for them, really 
                        PS: never forget your water bottle while travelling. Alas, when we got to the top, the landscape was mesmerizing</p>

                    <p>I was opportuned to attend AltSchool Africa's Conference on Saturday, 25th January, 2025. It was my
                        first Conference
                        and save to say, it was great by the way except there was no food...lol

                        recreational center in Ikeja. I played games and this was still the closest to being fine
                        of pictures I asked the attendant to take of me. Numerous picture, all with a touch of blur...lol
